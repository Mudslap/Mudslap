🎓 I am Vincent Aquino, a High Schooler who specializes in Front End Web Development, Game Development, and Python Coding. 

📃I really enjoy creating different games in both JavaScript, C#, and Pygame. Over my 7 years of coding, I have learned about different Python libraries such as NumPy, GPIO, and Pygame, built many websites with PyMongo, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PHP, and have also started learning about Java, C++, and C#. I love to learn more about new languages, expand my knowledge on these application, and build unique and diverse projects.

🏆I have also competed in over 7 different hackathons (coding competitions) thus far, and have managed to win 2 of them thanks to my different projects and games. I hope to keep on entering these competitions and continue to work, learn, and compete with others. 

🥁Outside of the world of code, I love finding new hobbies and activities to do. So far, I have found a variety of different hobbies such as playing basketball, football, the drums, video games, Speech and Debate, Robotics, and Kung Fu.
